PROBLEM2
--------

* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
  two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
  four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

PROBLEM 3
----------

* The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

PROBLEM 4
----------

* A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
  from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.

  Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

PROBLEM 5
----------

* 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from
  1 to 10 without any remainder.

  What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the
  numbers from 1 to 20?

PROBLEM 6
----------

* The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025  385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.
